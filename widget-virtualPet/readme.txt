Web Widget - Virtual Pet Simulation

Javascript is probably not the best tool for the job,
nor is this the best way to apply it, but I felt like
trying to see if I could do it anyhow just for kicks.

This item is not finished. I will try to see if I can

The aim is to create a scenario where you (yes, you!)
have a virtual pet with a few needs that continually
decrease. If your pet's needs run out, it will run away.
Click the appropriate buttons to replenish your pet's
needs and keep it happy.
